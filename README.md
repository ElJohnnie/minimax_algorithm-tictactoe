# Minimax TicTacToe

<p>
  In decision theory, minimax (or minmax) is a method for minimizing the maximum possible loss. 
  It can be considered as the maximization of the minimum gain (maximin). It starts with two 0-0 game theory players, 
  covering both cases where players take alternate paths (per rounds) or simultaneously.

## How to run

<p>First you need a runtime installed, Node suggestion. Run with: <b>node index.js</b></p>

## About the code

<p>This code was developed with the aim of studying the algorithm and its employability, the game gives you the possibility of playing with three or more dimensions of the board.</p>

## Give your best

<p>Do your best to beat the algorithm, I truly believe it will be a difficult challenge.</p>

## Working in progress
<p>
  The construction of the algorithm was primarily designed to use the Node runtime, as things work in a single thread, in the future the algorithm will include more workers to divide the processing load into larger dimensions.
